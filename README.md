## What is DocuMentor AI?

Ever felt overwhelmed reading technical documentation? Wondering if you're ready for that advanced tutorial, or if you should start with the basics first? **DocuMentor AI** is here to help!

This Chrome extension acts as your personal learning companion, using Chrome's powerful **built-in AI APIs** to:

- üìä **Analyze documentation** and tell you if it matches your skill level
- üìù **Generate cheat sheets** from any webpage for quick reference
- üí¨ **Explain complex concepts** in simple terms (even images and diagrams!)
- üéØ **Recommend learning resources** personalized to your needs
- üß† **Remember your learning journey** and adapt to your growing skills

The best part? **Everything runs locally** on your device using Chrome's Gemini Nano model. Your data never leaves your browser.

## üéØ The Secret Sauce: User Persona System

What makes DocuMentor AI different? **Personalization powered by AI.**

When you first use the extension, you'll create your **learning persona** - a profile that includes:

- Your role (student, developer, architect, etc.)
- Your technical skills and confidence levels
- Your learning goals
- Your preferred learning style (visual, reading, hands-on, or mixed)

Here's the magic: **Every single AI feature uses your persona** to tailor its responses!

**Example:**

- A **beginner** reading React docs gets explanations about JSX and components in simple terms
- An **expert** reading the same docs gets advanced patterns, performance tips, and architecture insights

Your persona evolves with you - track your progress, update skills, and watch the AI adapt to your growth!

## ‚ú® Features Powered by Chrome Built-in AI

DocuMentor AI leverages **three Chrome AI APIs** to create a comprehensive learning experience:

### 1. üìä Quick Scan

**APIs Used:** Summarizer API + Prompt API

Get an instant overview of any documentation page:

- **What it covers** - AI-generated summary of the page content
- **Should you read this?** - Personalized recommendation based on your goals
- **Page structure** - Outline of headings and sections
- **Related resources** - AI-curated links for deeper learning

**Use Case:** You land on a 10,000-word tutorial. Quick Scan tells you in 30 seconds if it's right for your level and what you'll learn.

---

### 2. üîç Deep Analysis

**APIs Used:** Summarizer API + Prompt API

Go beyond the surface with comprehensive analysis:

- **Overview** - Detailed summary of the content
- **Code patterns** - Analysis of code examples and their frequency
- **Video recommendations** - YouTube videos matched to the topic and your level
- **Related reading** - Categorized learning resources

**Use Case:** You're learning a new framework. Deep Analysis identifies the key patterns, finds beginner-friendly videos, and suggests follow-up reading.

---

### 3. üìã Cheat Sheet Generator

**APIs Used:** Writer API

Transform any documentation into a clean, downloadable cheat sheet:

- Automatically formatted in Markdown
- Includes key concepts, syntax, and examples
- Saved locally for offline reference
- Export individually or all at once

**Use Case:** Studying for an interview? Generate cheat sheets from multiple API docs and export them as a study bundle.

---

### 4. üí¨ Ask Me - Text Explanations

**APIs Used:** Prompt API

Select any text on a webpage and get instant, personalized explanations:

- **Explain like I'm 5** - Complex concepts in simple terms
- **More examples** - Additional code examples and use cases
- **Rewrite** - Alternative explanations if you didn't get it the first time
- **Follow-up questions** - Ask anything about the selected text

**Use Case:** You're reading about "closures" in JavaScript. Select the text, ask for an ELI5 explanation, and the AI breaks it down using your persona's context.

---

### 5. üñºÔ∏è Ask Me - Image Explanations

**APIs Used:** Prompt API (Multimodal)

Hover over any image (diagram, screenshot, chart) and click "Explain this image":

- AI analyzes the visual content
- Provides context-aware explanations
- Supports follow-up questions about the image
- Works with architecture diagrams, flowcharts, UI screenshots, etc.

**Use Case:** You see a complex system architecture diagram. The AI explains each component, how they connect, and relates it to your current skill level.

**Note:** Depending on the version of Google Chrome used, the Prompt AI may or may not supports Multimdals.

---

### 6. üéì Smart Recommendations

**APIs Used:** Prompt API

Every analysis includes AI-powered recommendations:

- **"Should I read this?"** - Personalized yes/no based on your goals and level
- **Video suggestions** - YouTube content matched to the topic and your learning style
- **Learning resources** - Prerequisites or advanced topics based on where you are

**Use Case:** Your persona says you're learning TypeScript. The AI notices the page covers advanced generics and suggests starting with basics first.

## üí° Technical Innovation Highlights

### üîó Three APIs, One Seamless Experience

Most Chrome AI extension demos use just one API. DocuMentor AI **combines all three** in creative ways:

- Use **Summarizer API** for fast, efficient content extraction
- Use **Writer API** for structured content generation (cheat sheets)
- Use **Prompt API** for complex reasoning, personalization, and multimodal understanding

### üß† Context-Aware AI with Persona System

Every AI interaction is enhanced with user context:

- Skills and confidence levels guide explanation complexity
- Learning goals influence recommendations
- Learning style preferences affect content format
- Usage statistics track progress over time

**Implementation:** The persona is serialized and injected as `sharedContext` in Writer API options and as system prompts for the Prompt API, ensuring consistent personalization.

### üñºÔ∏è Multimodal Content Understanding

Leveraging the **Prompt API's multimodal capabilities**:

- Supports both text and image inputs
- Converts base64 images to Blobs for API processing
- Maintains conversation context for follow-up questions about images
- Works with diagrams, screenshots, charts, and code snippets

### üîí Privacy-First Design

- **All AI processing happens locally** using Chrome's built-in Gemini Nano model
- **No external API calls** for AI features (except optional YouTube video search which requires )
- User personas stored in **Chrome Storage Sync** for cross-browser sync
- **No tracking, no telemetry, no cloud servers**
